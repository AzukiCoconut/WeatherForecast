# WeatherForecast
Get the 5 day weather forecast for your city

## Description
This is an application that retreives the current and 5-day forecast weather data for any city the user specifies.  The user enters a city in the search box and clicks "Search" and the current weather and 5-day weather forecast is displayed.  The application also will save the search history in local storage so that the user does not have to keep searching for the same city.  They can simply select it from the list.  This application makes use of OpenWeather.org's Current Weather and 5-day / 3 Hour Forecast API.  The application also uses the Geocoding API to get the Latitude and Longitude coordinates when the user enters a city for more accurate weather data.  My first introduction to using server side API's and it was a fun little project to work on.  In addition to the API used, I was able to make better use of Bootstrap and found how easy it is to build a more responsive website with this CSS Framwork.  

## Usage
